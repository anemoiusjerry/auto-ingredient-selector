                        <div class="paragraph">Jane Doe, Day Cream Instructions …, use in the morning after cleaning your face and cleansing.  I would recommend using a small amount and dotting it over your face then massaging this into your skin.  Only apply a very thin layer to the areas you feel are oilier (e.g. T-Zone).  I have used oils that will balance sebum production and oils that have a lower comedogenic rating so your pores do not get clogged.</div>

                        <div class="paragraph">It is recommended that you strip back your skincare routine to the basics and start with a blank slate. It is also recommended that you do not use other new skincare products while you are testing our products on your skin. The reason for this is you will not really know which of the products caused a reaction if you introduce too many at one time. If you usually do not have a problem with reactions on your skin, you should not have a reaction.</div>
