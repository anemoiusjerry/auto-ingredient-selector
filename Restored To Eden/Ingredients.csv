This reaction will likely occur due to the detoxifying properties of Virgin Coconut Oil that are powerful enough to purge layers of toxins from deep beneath the skin’s surface. This reaction will make skin appear as though the condition has worsened, but the irritation and inflammation will be temporary and will eventually decline in a matter of a few weeks – depending on the amount of toxin build-up – as the skin heals, improves, and clears up. To prevent the skin from flaring up in this manner, another possible option for acne-prone skin is to use Coconut Oil as a carrier for skin-soothing essential oils that are reputed to relieve acne.

Although it is a rare occurrence, Coconut Oil may potentially cause an allergic reaction that could involve anaphylaxis, eczema, facial swelling, hives, lightheadedness, nausea, rapid heart rate, rashes, or vomiting. Children with peanut or tree nut allergies are less likely to experience an allergic reaction to Coconut Oil, as coconuts are considered to be fruits rather than nuts; however, it is highly recommended that a doctor be consulted before these individuals use Coconut Oil.

Review
Biological and Pharmacological Activities of Squalene and Related Compounds: Potential Uses in Cosmetic Dermatology
Zih-Rou Huang 1, Yin-Ku Lin 2,3 and Jia-You Fang 1,*:
CONCLUSION: Squalene appears to be critical in reducing free radical oxidative damage to the skin. Although epidemiological, experimental, and animal evidence suggests antitumor properties, few human trials have been conducted to date to verify the role of squalene in cancer therapy. Further studies are needed to explore the usefulness of squalene for treating skin. Several implications can be drawn from this review. Squalene shows several advantages for skin tissues. It is also useful as a material in topically applied vehicles. Substances related to squalene such as β-carotene, coenzyme Q10, and vitamins A, E, and K also exhibit their benefits for skin physiology. Topical administration via the skin is an important route to supplement these compounds within skin tissues. The present success of squalene and its analogs shows the promise of further clinical trials for skin use.",,,

The oil should always be stored in an area that is inaccessible to children, especially those under the age of 7.  Individuals who are recovering from illnesses or who suffer from eating disorders should avoid using Patchouli Essential Oil, as it can cause a loss of appetite.  When applied topically, Patchouli Essential Oil should be used in dilution and in small amounts, as using the oil directly or in high concentrations can potentially cause skin irritation. A skin test is recommended prior to use. This can be done by diluting the essential oil in a carrier oil and applying a small amount to a small area of skin that is not sensitive. Once applied topically, sun exposure should be avoided, as the oil may sensitize the skin to UV rays.

Very strong aroma
Use in moderation",,,,,,,,"Contracindications : New Directions Aromatics :

As per NAHA guidelines, New Directions Aromatics (NDA) does not recommend the ingestion of essential oils. It is imperative to consult a medical practitioner before using this oil for therapeutic purposes. Pregnant and nursing women are especially advised not to use Ylang Ylang Essential Oil without the medical advice of a physician, as it may have an effect on certain hormone secretions and it is unclear whether these effects are transferable to babies at these stages of development. The oil should always be stored in an area that is inaccessible to children, especially those under the age of 7.

Those with the following health conditions are recommended to be advised: diabetes, cancer, low blood pressure and other heart-related ailments, peptic ulcers, liver damage, bleeding disorders, skin disorders, or hormone-related ailments. Individuals that are taking prescription drugs, undergoing major surgery, or who are at a greater risk of experiencing strokes, heart attacks, or atherosclerosis are also advised to seek medical consultation prior to use.

Prior to using Ylang Ylang Oil, a skin test is recommended. This can be done by diluting 1 drop of the Essential Oil in 4 drops of a Carrier Oil and applying a dime-size amount of this blend to a small area of skin that is not sensitive. Ylang Ylang Oil must never be used near the eyes, inner nose, and ears, or on any other particularly sensitive areas of skin. Potential side effects of Ylang Ylang Oil include sensitization, rashes, headache, and nausea.

Those seeking medical care to manage moods, behaviors, or disorders should treat this essential oil as a complementary remedy rather than a replacement for any medicinal treatments or prescriptions. In the event of an allergic reaction, discontinue use of the product and see a doctor, pharmacist, or allergist immediately for a health assessment and appropriate remedial action. To prevent side effects, consult with a medical professional prior to use.",,
